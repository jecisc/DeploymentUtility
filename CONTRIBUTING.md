# Release management

This project use semantic versioning to define the releases. This means that each stable release of the project will be assigned a version number of the form `vX.Y.Z`. 

- **X**Â defines the major version number
- **Y** defines the minor version number 
- **Z** defines the patch version number

When a release contains only bug fixes, the patch number increases. When the release contains new features that are backward compatible, the minor version increases. When the release contains breaking changes, the major version increases. 

Thus, it should be safe to depend on a fixed major version and moving minor version of this project.

# Branch management 

This project use gitflow management.

This project contains two main branches:
- **master** : This branch is a stable branch. Each version on this branch should be a stable release of the project, and ideally each commit modifying the source code of the project should be tagged with a version number.
- **development** : This branch contains the current development of this project. 

## New feature 

When a new feature will take some time to implement, this feature should be developed in a specific branch. Once done, it will be merged in development before the next release of this project.

## Hot fix

If a bug is found in a stable version and the correction is backward compatible, it should be corrected in an hotfix branch. Once the correction is finished the hotfix branch should be merged into master and development and a new bugfix release should be done.
